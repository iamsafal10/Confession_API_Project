# Confession_API_Project
# Anonymous Confession Website

This is a simple web application that allows users to send anonymous confessions to their loved ones and retrieve confessions sent to them based on their roll number. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface and interacts with a backend API to handle the confessions.

- **Get Confession**: Users can retrieve confessions sent to their roll number.

## Technologies Used
